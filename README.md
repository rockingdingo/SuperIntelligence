# SuperIntelligence package

This is the official github repo of pypi package SuperIntelligence (https://pypi.org/project/SuperIntelligence). 

Much attention has been attracted to the area of ASI (Artifical Super Intelligence), AGI (Artifical General Intelligence) and AI safety, how to better instruct or align the superintelligence that may all of a sudden surpassing human intelligence. One key motiviation is coming from Isaac Asimov's famous "Three Laws of Robotics", which is more like a sci-fiction rather than exact science:

```
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
```

Right now this repo has just started from scratch. We want to build some common interface to train/eval/deploy superintelligence or superalignment related models and you are very welcome to contact us if you have any cool ideas that would like to participate and collabratively commit to this repo. 

```
pip install SuperIntelligence
```


```
import SuperIntelligence as si
